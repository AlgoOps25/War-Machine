| 27 | 2026-03-25 | S10 | `app/ml/metrics_cache.py` | 🔧 FIXED: Raw SQLAlchemy pool replaced with `get_conn()`/`return_conn()`. | manual patch | Connection leak eliminated |
| 28 | 2026-03-27 | S11 | `app/ml/metrics_cache.py` | 🔧 FIXED BUG-ML-2: `%(since)s` named param → `ph()` positional + tuple. | `900e211` | ML feature correctness |
| 29 | 2026-03-27 | S11 | `app/ml/ml_signal_scorer_v2.py` | 🔧 FIXED BUG-ML-1: Created missing file — Gate 5 was silently dead. | `0fad513` | Gate 5 ML now functional |
| 30 | 2026-03-27 | S11 | `app/analytics/performance_monitor.py` | 🔧 FIXED BUG-ML-6: `_consecutive_losses` counter wired + Discord alert. | `74ce832` | Risk control now active |
| 31 | 2026-03-27 | S11 | `docs/AUDIT_REGISTRY.md` | Session 11 logged. | `f4fc398` | Registry current |
| 32 | 2026-03-27 | S12 | `app/mtf/mtf_compression.py` | 🔧 FIXED BUG-MTF-1: `compress_to_1m()` direction-aware high/low step placement. | `6fc7c7b` | FVG signal quality fix |
| 33 | 2026-03-27 | S12 | `app/mtf/mtf_fvg_priority.py` | 🔧 FIXED BUG-MTF-2: volume check moved from `c2` → `c1` (impulse bar). | `137f36f` | FVG volume filter correctness |
| 34 | 2026-03-27 | S12 | `app/mtf/mtf_fvg_priority.py` | 🔧 FIXED BUG-MTF-3: `get_full_mtf_analysis()` now builds `15m`+`30m` bars. | `137f36f` | Higher-TF FVG detection now active |
| 35 | 2026-03-29 | S13 | `app/core/sniper.py` | ✅ CONFIRMED: `clear_bos_alerts()` public API present. `_orb_classifications` dead block already absent — repo was clean. | live | EOD dedup reset works |
| 36 | 2026-03-29 | S13 | `app/core/scanner.py` | ✅ CONFIRMED: `clear_bos_alerts()` imported + called at EOD. Dead functions (`_extract_premarket_metrics`, `should_scan_now`) already absent. Full line-by-line audit complete — no bugs found. | live | Scanner EOD reset complete |
| 37 | 2026-03-30 | S14-pre | `models/signal_predictor.pkl` + `models/training_dataset.csv` | ✅ CONFIRMED never tracked — `models/` directory does not exist in repo. `.gitignore` rule from S2 (`5828488`) was effective from the start. | n/a | Items #13 + #14 closed |
| 38 | 2026-03-30 | S14-pre | `s16_helpers.txt` | ❌ DELETED root staging file — confirmed duplicate of live `app/risk/position_helpers.py`. | `2cb2020` | Root cleaned |
| 39 | 2026-03-30 | S14-pre | `s16_trade.txt` | ❌ DELETED root staging file — confirmed duplicate of live `app/risk/trade_calculator.py`. | `09f25f8` | Root cleaned |
| 40 | 2026-03-30 | S14-pre | `s16_vix.txt` | ❌ DELETED root staging file — confirmed duplicate of live `app/risk/vix_sizing.py`. | `72abc33` | Root cleaned |
| 41 | 2026-03-30 | S14 | `app/risk/risk_manager.py` | 🔧 FIXED BUG-RISK-1: `_reject()` refactored — removed redundant `compute_stop_and_targets()` call on every early-gate rejection. Now accepts optional pre-computed `stop/t1/t2` kwargs (default 0.0). Gates 1–8 short-circuit with zeros; Gate 10 (R:R) passes in already-computed values. Eliminated wasted ATR math on kill switch / circuit breaker / position count rejections. | `5f651ff` | Perf + correctness |
| 42 | 2026-03-30 | S14 | `app/risk/position_manager.py` | ✅ AUDIT COMPLETE — no new bugs found. BUG-PM-1/2/3 confirmed fixed in file. Post-close circuit breaker block confirmed informational-only by design (live check fires on next `can_open_position()` call). All DB calls use `get_conn()`/`return_conn()`, caches busted on every write, FIX #4/7/8/9/12/13 all confirmed present and correct. | live | No changes needed |
| 43 | 2026-03-30 | S14 | `app/core/sniper_pipeline.py` | 🔧 FIXED BUG-SP-1: TIME gate moved above RVOL fetch — eliminates wasted `data_manager.get_rvol()` call on every post-11am signal. Gate order comment updated to match. | `7f5b377` | Perf fix |
| 44 | 2026-03-30 | S14 | `app/core/sniper_pipeline.py` + `app/core/signal_scorecard.py` | 🔧 FIXED BUG-SP-2: `confidence_base` from `grade_signal_with_confirmations()` was computed and silently discarded. Now passed into `build_scorecard()` as `cfw6_confidence_base`. `signal_scorecard.py` updated: new `_score_cfw6_confidence()` function (+0–10pts, linear scale: ≥0.80=10, ≥0.70=7, ≥0.60=5, ≥0.50=3, else 0). `SignalScorecard` dataclass updated with `cfw6_score` field. Breakdown string updated. Max scorecard total raised from 85 → 95. | `7f5b377` / `032ffcc` | Signal quality: CFW6 confirmation strength now influences arming |
| 45 | 2026-03-30 | S14 | `app/core/arm_signal.py` | 🔧 FIXED BUG-ARM-1: Moved module docstring above `import logging` / `logger` assignment so `arm_signal.__doc__` is correctly populated. Previously the string literal appeared after the logger assignment and was treated as a dead expression by Python. Zero runtime impact but corrects introspection. | `0165db5` | Cosmetic / introspection fix |
| 46 | 2026-03-30 | S14 | `app/core/arm_signal.py` | ✅ BUG-ARM-2 RETRACTED — `sniper_log.py` confirmed still present in repo (not deleted in S9 as registry previously noted). `log_proposed_trade` import is safe. Registry note on S9 deletion was incorrect. | live | No action needed |
